    <div class="content"> <p>It&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;ve been squatting on several domain names for a while, including this one, which means I&rsquo;ve been a bad internet citizen.  I hope to correct that in 2018 starting with this post.</p>

<p>One of the items blocking me from doing something with my internet properties sooner is that it costs money to host custom web content.  At least, that&rsquo;s how it used to be!  I don&rsquo;t need dynamic content (no database hosting)&hellip; I just need a place to serve static HTML.  Last year, _bam!_, I learned about Github Pages.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  This would allow me to create a site using simple HTML, or better yet use a static site generator (like Jekyll or Hugo), and host my site for free on Github.  I could even point my custom domain name to the site.  Other nice goodies include version control, the ability to collaborate with others, and nifty features like a web-based editor if I need to change something on the go.  I was ready to hit the ground running&hellip; and then, my twins were born.  Sleepless nights would keep me from doing anything until now.</p>

<p>Fast forward to just recently, and as I redid my search for static site generators and Github web hosting, I learned about Hugo and Netlify.  Hugo is similar to Jeklly, but appears to be lighter weight, templating made more sense to me immediately, and should I ever need to mess with the code it is in Go vs. Ruby (not that anything is wrong with Ruby, Go is just becoming more popular).</p>

<p>The real magic for me was Netlify.  I have tech skills, but I&rsquo;m also a pointy-haired manager type, so I don&rsquo;t practice my computer engineering kung-fu as often as most of you.  Setting up a Github page, while super simple in tech terms, still always felt slightly labored.  Netlify made things super simple!  <code>hugo ; netlify deploy</code> after some very minor setup on Netlify&rsquo;s website.  Netlify walked me through the entire setup of custom domain name records, CI/CD integration (including pull request preview) for my domain, and their documentation is SPOT on.  I never even had to think about getting hung up on a step, as their documentation was concise yet dead-on.  Kudos to whoever writes their docs!  Actually, I don&rsquo;t ever need to <code>netlify deploy</code> anymore.  All I do is write a post in Markdown, then <code>git push -u origin master</code>.  BAM!!</p>

<p>If you are a techie looking for a way to start a blog or host a static website, checkout Netlify (and Hugo &ndash; or Jekyll).  You&rsquo;ll be glad you did.</p>
