I am very proud to share that I received a Grow With Google Scholarship.  While 15,000 or so were awarded, I still feel priveledged to have the opportunity to learn a new skill due to the generosity of Google and Udacity.  The itch to code again has been increasing for me.  Getting accepted to this program has allowed me to learn the basics of android development and start creating an app that I've wanted for a long time, and I'm happy to say I've already started on it.

If you haven't taken an [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) course, I highly recommend you check them out the next time you want to learn a new skill.  Before taking their Introduction to Android course, I knew almost nothing.  I had done a Hello World android app several years ago.  Keep in mind, I DON'T know the Java language.  Here's an app they taught me to build within the first few weeks.

I'm excited to be able to share more soon.
